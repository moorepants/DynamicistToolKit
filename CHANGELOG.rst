Release Notes
=============

0.6.2
=====

- Bug fix: Pass norm argument to numpy.fft.fft() in process.freq_spectrum() [PR `#55`_]
- Correct normalization for power spectra from ortho to forward. The magnitudes
  of the power spectra continue to satisfy Parseval's Theorem. [PR `#55`_]
- Add pyproject.toml file.

.. _#55: https://github.com/moorepants/DynamicistToolKit/pull/55

0.6.1
=====

- Include ``make.bat`` in the source tarball.
- Make compatible with NumPy 2.0. [PR `#53`_]

.. _#53: https://github.com/moorepants/DynamicistToolKit/pull/53

0.6.0
=====

- Drop support for Python <3.8 and bumped dependency versions to match Ubuntu
  22.04. [PR `#40`_]
- Changed the correction factor in ``butterworth`` to a digital filter
  correction instead of the prior used analog factor (backwards incompatible
  output). [PR `#43`_]
- Add new functions ``pow_spectrum`` and ``cumulative_power_spectrum``. [PR
  `#45`_]
- Switched testing framework from nose (fails on Python 3.12) to pytest. [PR
  `#46`_]
- Display the control module functions in the Sphinx documentation. [PR `#47`_]
- Removed numpy.matrix in favor of numpy.array, which may lead to possible
  backwards incompatible outputs.
- Added examples to all functions with doctests and improved docstring quality.
- Repaired some functions to actually produce what they were designed to
  produce with the new dependencies (there was some rather archaic plotting
  code mostly).
- Switched CI from Travis to Github Actions.
- Removed old Vagrant based installation options.

0.5.2
=====

- Screwed up pypi upload on 0.5.1, so bumping one more time.

0.5.1
=====

- Import nanmean from numpy instead of scipy and fix float slices. [PR `#34`_]

.. _#34: https://github.com/moorepants/DynamicistToolKit/pull/34

0.5.0
=====

- bicycle.py functions now output numpy arrays instead of matrices.
- Support for Python 3 [PR `#30`_ and `#32`_].

.. _#32: https://github.com/moorepants/DynamicistToolKit/pull/32

0.4.0
=====

- Made the numerical derivative function more robust and featureful. [PR
  `#27`_]
- ``butterworth`` now uses a corrected cutoff frequency to adjust for the
  double filtering. [PR `#28`_]

.. _#27: https://github.com/moorepants/DynamicistToolKit/pull/27
.. _#28: https://github.com/moorepants/DynamicistToolKit/pull/28
